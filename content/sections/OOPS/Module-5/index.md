### Part 1: Java Generic Types and Collections

In Java, generics are used to specify, at compile time, the types of objects that a class can operate on. This feature provides stronger type checks, eliminates casts, and supports code reusability.

For instance, a non-generic box class might look like this:

```java
public class Box {
    private Object object;

    public void set(Object object) {
        this.object = object;
    }

    public Object get() {
        return object;
    }
}
```

We can make this class generic by introducing a type variable "T":

```java
public class Box<T> {
    // T stands for "Type"
    private T t;

    public void set(T t) {
        this.t = t;
    }

    public T get() {
        return t;
    }
}
```

Collections are a framework that provides architectures for storing and manipulating groups of data. Examples of collections include ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, and HashMap.

Here's how we might use a generic collection, an `ArrayList`, for example:

```java
ArrayList<String> items = new ArrayList<String>();
items.add("Apple");
items.add("Banana");
items.add("Cherry");
```
#### Some important methods in collection framework
- `add` 
- `size` 
- `remove` 
- `iterate` 
- `addAll` 
- `removeAll` 
- `clear`

### Part 2: GUI Programming with Scala and Swing

Swing is a GUI widget toolkit for Java. It is part of Oracle's Java Foundation Classes (JFC) â€“ an API for providing a graphical user interface (GUI) for Java programs. Scala is a modern programming language designed to express common programming patterns in a concise, elegant, and type-safe way. It smoothly integrates features of object-oriented and functional languages, so you can easily build Swing-based GUI with it.

```scala
import scala.swing._

object HelloWorld extends SimpleSwingApplication {
  def top = new MainFrame {
    title = "Hello, World!"
    contents = new Label("Hello, World!")
  }
}

HelloWorld.main(Array())
```

### Part 3: The Software Development Process

The software development process, also known as the software lifecycle, involves several distinct stages:

1. **Requirements Analysis:** Identify what the software is supposed to do, its performance levels, interface requirements, design constraints, etc.

2. **Design:** Develop the software architecture or design, which will serve as a blueprint for coding.

3. **Implementation:** The actual coding of the software. This stage also includes unit testing.

4. **Testing:** Check the software for bugs and any deviation from the requirements.

5. **Deployment:** Make the software available to users.

6. **Maintenance:** Fix any problems that users find.

Each of these stages is crucial in developing a working, efficient software product. In fact, the understanding of software development process can help a developer to plan, manage, and execute the software project more efficiently.

Good luck with your final semester examinations! Remember, practice is key when it comes to mastering programming concepts.
